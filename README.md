##An app to detect Pneumonia using Deep Learning
- In this project two models ANN and CNN were built from scratch using TensorFlow and Keras
- The problem statement is to detect whether patient is having pneumonia or not by training models with x-ray images
- After Comparing the accuracies of both the deep learning models best model was selected for further deployment on android application
- The model was converted in .tflite format in order to deploy it using TensorFlowlite dependencies in flutter
- UI of app was done using Flutter and Dart while functionalities were implemented using TensorFlowlite libraries
- The app enables user to click and image of x-ray or select the image from app storage or drive to check the results
- UI is configured in such a way that the result is displayed on the screen
- If patient has pneumonia a short and useful prescription from experienced doctors is made available in the app itself
