## **An app to detect Pneumonia using Deep Learning üß†üì±**
- In this project **two models ANN and CNN** were built from scratch using **TensorFlow and Keras**
- The problem statement is to detect whether patient is having pneumonia or not by training models with x-ray images
- **Data Augmentation** was performed and the main reason behind it is to provide maximum randomness to the training data where we use a function to shuffle images, make minor changes, and save images accordingly because it is a good practice to provide as much randomness as possible in order to achieve good accuracy on real-time data and testing data
- **Separable Convolutional layers** were used which proved to be more robust and powerful
- After Comparing the accuracies of both the deep learning models best model was selected for further deployment on android application
- The model was converted in **.tflite** format in order to deploy it using TensorFlowlite dependencies in flutter
- UI of app was done using Flutter and Dart while functionalities were implemented using **TensorFlowlite** libraries
- The app enables user to click an image of x-ray or select the image from app storage or drive to check the results
- UI is configured in such a way that the result is displayed on the screen
- If patient has pneumonia a short and useful prescription from experienced doctors is made available in the app itself
- The models were built on **Google Colab** by fetching data through **Kaggle API**
